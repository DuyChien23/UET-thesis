# Technologies and Security

## Technologies to Use

1. **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
2. **Web Framework**: Flask or FastAPI for REST API
3. **Cryptography Libraries**:
   - Core functionality: cryptography, pycryptodome
   - Curve implementations: consider custom implementations for learning purposes

## Security Considerations

1. Implement secure random number generation for cryptographic operations
2. Never request or store private keys from clients
3. Accept only pre-signed documents from clients
4. Use constant-time algorithms to prevent timing attacks
5. Follow cryptographic best practices for each algorithm
6. Add proper error handling and logging

## Development Plan

1. Create core interfaces and abstract classes
2. Implement the AlgorithmRegistry
3. Implement Public Key Management
4. Implement ECDSA Verification Providers (starting with secp256k1)
5. Implement Verification Services
6. Add CLI interface
7. Add REST API interface
8. Implement additional algorithm providers
9. Create comprehensive testing suite
10. Benchmark performance
