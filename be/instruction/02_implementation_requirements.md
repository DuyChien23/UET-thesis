# Implementation Requirements

## Core Components

1. **SignatureAlgorithmProvider Interface**:
   - Define abstract methods: `get_algorithm_name()`, `verify()`
   - All algorithm implementations should inherit from this interface
   - Note: Client is responsible for key generation and signing operations

2. **AlgorithmRegistry**:
   - Implement a registry system to manage available algorithm providers
   - Provide methods to register and retrieve algorithm providers
   - Support default algorithm selection

3. **Public Key Management**:
   - Implement public key storage and retrieval
   - Implement key format conversion for public keys (PEM, DER, etc.)
   - Support registration and management of user public keys

4. **Verification Service**:
   - Implement signature verification functionality
   - Handle different signature formats and conversions
   - Verify pre-signed documents submitted by clients

## Algorithm Implementations

1. **ECDSA Provider**:
   - Implement for multiple curves: secp256k1, P-256, Curve25519
   - Implement server-side signature verification

2. **Other Providers (optional)**:
   - RSA Provider with different key sizes
   - EdDSA Provider with Ed25519
   - Post-quantum signature algorithms (future)

## User Interfaces

1. **Command Line Interface**:
   - Public key management commands
   - Signature verification commands

2. **REST API**:
   - Endpoints for public key management
   - Endpoints for pre-signed document verification
   - Endpoints for signature verification
