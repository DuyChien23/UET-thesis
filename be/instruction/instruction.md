# Digital Signature System Backend Generator

This document provides an overview of the Digital Signature System backend project. The detailed documentation has been broken down into smaller files for better readability.

## Documentation Structure

1. [Overview and System Architecture](01_overview.md)
   - Project overview
   - System architecture components

2. [Implementation Requirements](02_implementation_requirements.md)
   - Core components
   - Algorithm implementations
   - User interfaces

3. [Technologies and Security](03_technologies_security.md)
   - Technologies to use
   - Security considerations
   - Development plan

4. [Project Structure and Testing](04_project_structure.md)
   - Project directory structure
   - Testing requirements
   - Deployment considerations

5. [Database Design](05_database.md)
   - Database schema
   - Tables and relationships
   - Indexing strategy
   - Security considerations

6. [API Endpoints](06_api_endpoints.md)
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Algorithm information
   - Curve management
   - Public key management
   - Signature verification
   - System information

## Key System Features

- Modular architecture inspired by Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)
- Support for multiple signature algorithms (ECDSA, RSA, EdDSA)
- Management of elliptic curves with support for secp256k1, P-256, Curve25519
- Client-side key generation and signing operations
- Server-side signature verification only
- Public key storage and management
- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive API for verification and key management

## Implementation Approach

The system follows these core principles:

1. **Security First**: Private keys remain with clients, never sent to the server
2. **Modularity**: Easily extend with new algorithms or curves
3. **Robustness**: Comprehensive testing and error handling
4. **Standards Compliance**: Following cryptographic best practices
5. **Documentation**: All code, APIs, and processes well documented

## Getting Started

Start by reviewing the [overview document](01_overview.md) to understand the project's architecture and design principles, then proceed through the other documents as needed.

For implementation, follow the [development plan](03_technologies_security.md#development-plan) outlined in the technologies document.
